Q 1)  What is cloud computing?

Ans)  Cloud Computing is the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet

`	`with pay- as-you going pricing. Cloud Computing helps user to upload the software on 	

`	`the cloud , so everyone can access the software from the internet.Instead of buying the 	    	machine we are renting the machine and servers remotely and you can access the 

`	`technology.In today there are many cloud providers who provides these services like  

` 	`AWS(amazon),Azure(Microsoft) and GCP(Google) etc. They provide cloud computing 

` 	`across the world

Q 2) What are the key characteristics of cloud computing?

Ans) There are many key characteristics some characteristics  are : - 

- **On-demand Service** - In this developers can choose their machine and customize there according to their needs. An admin can set the policies for the IAM user , so the IAM user can use only these functions that  they need .

- ` `**Resource Pooling** - Resource Pooling is a cloud computing service that allow multiple clients  to use the services like storage, processing power and memory from a service provider



- `  `**Scalability and rapid elasticity -**  In this when the software receives a heavy traffic on 	the software. If cloud user on the auto scaling  then the cloud  provider will increase the system for the user according to the need that is present on the software



- **Pay-per-use Pricing** - This is the best feature of cloud computing that the bill will generate according to the use. If you use less then the price will be less and if you use more then the price will be more. It totally depends on the user use, user can see the usage 

- **Broad Network Access** - In this broad network access the user can access from anywhere the software through the internet. Users can work from any location.


Q 3) What are the deployment models of cloud computing?

Ans)  There are three types of deployment model of the cloud computing are : 



- **Public Cloud** - The public cloud offers computerized services that offered by the third party over the public internet, making them available to anyone who want to use the software

- **Private Cloud** - Private cloud is defined as offers computerized computing services over the  private internal network only specific selected user can use these software or services

- **Hybrid Cloud** -  Hybrid cloud is defined as offers computerized computing  services to the public and private both the user (but in private user can see the confidential data) public can see all the data except private data


Q 4)  What are the different service models in cloud computing?

Ans)  There are different service model in the cloud computing are : 

- **IaaS** - IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service model, It provides virtualized services over the internet and its a type of cloud computing services that offers essential compute services,storage, and networking resources on a pay as you go basis ex: AWS,Azure ,GCP etc

- **PaaS** - PaaS stands for Platform as a Service , It provides software and hardware tools over the internet and It is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud ex: AWS elastic Beanstalk, Azure PaaS, GCP cloud run etc

- **SaaS**  -  Saas stands for software as a service , It delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis ex : Google workspace, office 365 etc.


Q 5) What are the benefits of cloud computing?

Ans)  There are many benefits of cloud computing are : 

- **Scalability and flexibility**

- **Advanced Security**

- **Data loss prevention**

- **Accessibility anywhere with any device**

- **High performance and availability**

- **Cost saving**

- **Quick Application deployment**

Q 6) What is AWS?

Ans)  AWS stands for Amazon web services . AWS provides cloud computing to the user, It's one of the famous and industry leading cloud providers. AWS offers 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Some  famous features of AWS are EC2,S3 bucket,IAM and VPC etc.AWS has a large ecosystem .


Q 7)What are the benefits of using AWS?
